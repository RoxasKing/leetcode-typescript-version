/*
  Given an array of integers nums and an integer limit, return the size of the longest non-empty subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to limit.

  Example 1:
    Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
    Output: 2
    Explanation: All subarrays are:
    [8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
    [8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
    [8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
    [8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
    [2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
    [2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
    [2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
    [4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
    [4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
    [7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4.
    Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.

  Example 2:
    Input: nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.

  Example 3:
    Input: nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0
    Output: 3

  Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
    1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
    0 <= limit <= 10^9
