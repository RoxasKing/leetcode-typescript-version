/*
  You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

  We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:

    If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
    If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.

  At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

  Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

  Example 1:
    Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
    Output: 1
    Explanation:
      We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
      we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
      we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
      we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array converts to [1], then that's the optimal value.

  Example 2:
    Input: stones = [31,26,33,21,40]
    Output: 5

  Example 3:
    Input: stones = [1,2]
    Output: 1

  Constraints:
    1. 1 <= stones.length <= 30
    2. 1 <= stones[i] <= 100
