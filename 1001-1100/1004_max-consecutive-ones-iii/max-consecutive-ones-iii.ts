/*
  Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.
  Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s.

  Example 1:
    Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
    Output: 6
    Explanation:
    [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
    Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.

  Example 2:
    Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
    Output: 10
    Explanation:
    [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
    Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.

  Note:
    1. 1 <= A.length <= 20000
    2. 0 <= K <= A.length
    3. A[i] is 0 or 1
